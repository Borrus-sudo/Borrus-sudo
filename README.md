### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi I am Jinmay Jhaveri (a.k.a BorrisX), 15 year old junior full stack web dev. (P.S. soon to be senior). I am game dev enthusiastic and a Potter head. I am the founder and CEO of JCorp that primarily focuses on improving DX of Vue developers. I am a staunch believer in the tagline "Don't be Dinesh!".
<br/>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on vue-generator-graph(not yet open sourced).
<br/>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Typescript and Elixir.
<br/>âš¡ Fun fact:Open a repo and append '1s' after github and before .com in the URL to get the VS Code view of the repo
