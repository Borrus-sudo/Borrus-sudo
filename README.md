### Hi there  <img src="https://github.com/Andy-Python-Programmer/Andy-Python-Programmer/blob/master/hello.gif" style="margin-top:5px;" height="25px">
Hi I am JSGandalf (a.k.a BorrisX or Borrus-sudo), 15 year old junior full stack web dev. (P.S. soon to be senior). I am game dev enthusiastic and a Potter head. I am the founder and CEO of JCorp that primarily focuses on improving DX of Vue developers. I am a staunch believer in the tagline "Don't be Dinesh!".
<br/>🔭 I’m currently planning to work on a long term project which I hope gets a surrounding community.
<br/>🌱 I’m currently planning to learn Golang.

<br/>⚡ Fun fact:Open a repo and append '1s' after github and before .com in the URL to get the VS Code view of the repo
<br/>📫 How to reach me: BorrisX#2830 on discord
